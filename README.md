The task involves developing a C program that searches for a specific array within a 10x10 table. When the array is found in a row of the table, the program reverses the elements of the array within that row.

Instructions:

Write a C program with the following functionalities:

Generate a 10x10 table filled with random numbers ranging from 1 to 9, with one element set to 0.
Define an array containing integers.
Search for instances of the array in each row of the table.
If the array is detected in a row, reverse its elements within that row.
Print the table before and after the modifications.
Ensure the program is adequately commented and adheres to standard coding conventions.

Test the program using various arrays to validate its correctness.

Submit the C source code file with a descriptive name reflecting the program's purpose.
